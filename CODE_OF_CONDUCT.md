# Contributor Code of Conduct

This project follows the Contributor Covenant v2.1. All participants are
expected to abide by this code of conduct. Be respectful and professional
in all communications, and treat other contributors with empathy.

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it by
opening an issue in this repository with the label `private` or contact
the repository maintainers. If the issue contains sensitive information,
do not include it publicly — instead request a private channel or use the
official BC Government reporting procedures.
