# Plugin Manager Distribution

This repository hosts the source code for the **Plugin Manager**, a powerful meta-plugin designed to bridge, replicate, and maintain your Claude Code ecosystem.

## 📦 What's Inside?

The core of this repository is located in `plugins/plugin-mapper/`. This tool allows you to:

1.  **Bridge Capabilities**: Make your Claude plugins work seamlessly in **GitHub Copilot**, **Google Gemini**, and **Antigravity**.
2.  **Replicate Plugins**: Synchronize plugins from a central source to multiple local projects, keeping your tools up-to-date everywhere.
3.  **Audit Structure**: Ensure your plugins follow the standardized architecture for maximum compatibility and maintainability.

> ℹ️ **Live Example**: This repository is a self-referential example. The `.github/`, `.gemini/`, and `.agent/` directories you see here were generated by running the `plugin-mapper` on itself.


## 🚀 Getting Started

To use the Plugin Manager in your projects:

1.  **Install Plugins**:
    *   Create a `plugins/` directory in your project root.
    *   Copy the `plugins/plugin-mapper` folder into it.
    *   (Optional) Copy any other plugins you want to bridged into the `plugins/` directory as well.
2.  **Create Target Directories**: The bridge installer looks for existing environment folders. Create them if they haven't been initialized yet:
    ```bash
    mkdir .github .gemini .agent
    ```
3.  **Run the Installer**:
    ```bash
    python3 plugins/plugin-mapper/scripts/install_all_plugins.py
    ```

For detailed documentation and usage instructions, please refer to the [Plugin Manager README](plugins/plugin-mapper/README.md).
